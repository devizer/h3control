Added optional password protection of changing frequency. How Dow do we do it? First, encrypt password:
>./h3control-console.sh -g=mySecret
7D018BB3DF0E523692845AF1F27E992CE8A41650
Finally, add parameter -p=7D018BB3DF0E523692845AF1F27E992CE8A41650 to h3control-console.sh or /etc/init.d/h3control daemon. For example:
>./h3control-console.sh -p=7D018BB3DF0E523692845AF1F27E992CE8A41650 -b=*:5000
Without -p option behavior is the same as prev version - Anybody from white-list, or anybody, can change frequency of an Orange PI
